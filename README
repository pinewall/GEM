Gradient Enhanced reMap ==> GEM

Try to Enhance Remap netCDF file through Gradients
./gem -r remapfile -m gradient-algorithm -o enchenced-remapfile

More Design Goals:
1. IO_netCDF:
    support templates: simplify netCDF IO code work

2. SparseMatrix:
    support matrix-vector multiplication
    support matrix-matrix addition / substraction
    support parallel operation

3. gradient:
    support multiple gradient calculation methods

4. innovation:
    seperate remap algorithm and gradient algorithm: suit for all remap platform

===========How To Use==========
run make lib
run make unit_test
./unit_test remap_ncfile test_function > script/value
cd script
(local) 
    ncl remap_compare.ncl
(server) 
    ./update remap_ncfile
    ./update value
    (ssh to server)
    ncl remap_compare.ncl
    ./fetch.sh
         
Note: remap_ncfile should be A_B.nc and test_function can be coslat_coslon, cosbell, Y2_2, and Y16_32
