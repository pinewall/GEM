Gradient Enhanced reMap ==> GEM

Try to Enhance Remap netCDF file through Gradients
./gem -r remapfile -m gradient-algorithm -o enchenced-remapfile

More Design Goals:
1. IO_netCDF:
    support templates: simplify netCDF IO code work

2. SparseMatrix:
    support matrix-vector multiplication
    support matrix-matrix addition / substraction
    support parallel operation

3. gradient:
    support multiple gradient calculation methods

4. innovation:
    seperate remap algorithm and gradient algorithm: suit for all remap platform
